## My understandings

I mentioned about my understanding from the Improved calculator module.

Understood the static methods and some other oops concepts, also understood about the solid principles from the improved2 branch of the code

Implemented static method and classes in Improved2

Understood the implementations of exceptions and their importance

Implemented the a Throw exception for division by zero and also implemented a method to store the history of calculations, get the latest calaculation, add a calculation, clearing the history in the part3 of the code.
